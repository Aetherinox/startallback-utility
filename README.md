# Usage

If you wish to simply use the keygen, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Aetherinox/startallback-activator/releases) section and download the latest binary as a `zip` or `rar`. The download is a single `exe`.

- `SABActivator.exe`

<br />

# Build

Download the source files and launch the `.csproj` project file in Visual Studio.

If you decide to modify or re-build my code, you are to not re-distribute. These sources are for learning purposes and should not be used in order to take advantage of others.

# Signed Releases

As of `v1.0.0.0` and onwards, binaries are GPG signed with the key `CB5C4C30CD0D4028`. You can find the key available on most keyservers:

- [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.mit.edu/)
- [keyserver.ubuntu.com](keyserver.ubuntu.com)
- [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org)

Binaries are also signed with a certificate which has the Thumbprint `70575bdfb02b3f1b45a37431bef9a8c9933a4ace`. If you downloaded this elsewhere on the internet and the binary is not signed with that certificate serial number; **IT IS NOT MINE**. You should delete it.

# Virus Scans

Unfortunately, virus scanners such as VirusTotal can report false positives. There's not much control I have over that. These websites will also attempt to detect keygens; sometimes you can get by it, and sometimes you can't.

The only option I'd have is to contact these websites and tell them that it's a false positive, but I'm writing a keygen; I highly doubt they're going to be happy with doing anything.

I scanned with Windows Defender and it reported that the files are clean.
